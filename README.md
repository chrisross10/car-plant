# Car Plant

## "Favor 'object composition' over 'class inheritance'."

The original source code is taken from XP Surgery. Click [here](http://bit.ly/xpsurgery-car-plant-zip) to download the original code.

The use of inheritance in OOP can be fraught with danger, especially when the business requirements start stacking up with increasing complexity. This kata is designed to help with the technique of transforming a code-base built using inheritance to one using object composition.

To begin with, four of the tests are red. You need to refactor the code and get the tests back to being green.

#### Rules
1. The test methods cannot change and must be used to verify your refactorings are sound.
2. The Car Plant's method signatures cannot change either, but it's implementations can.
